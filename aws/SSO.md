### AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

**AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a cloud-based service that enables you to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and applications using a single set of credentials. It integrates with various identity providers (IdPs), including Microsoft Active Directory and other SAML 2.0 compatible IdPs.

#### Key Features

1. **Centralized Access Management**
   - Manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications from a central location.
   - Assign user permissions based on job roles and enforce consistent access policies.

2. **Single Sign-On**
   - Enable users to sign in once to access multiple AWS accounts and applications without needing to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

3. **Integration with Identity Providers**
   - Supports integration with corporate directories like Microsoft Active Directory.
   - Compatible with SAML 2.0 identity providers, allowing integration with third-party IdPs like Google Workspace.

4. **User Portal**
   - Provides a user-friendly web portal where users can find and access all their assigned accounts and applications.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Enforce MFA for an additional layer of security during the sign-in process.

6. **Auditing and Reporting**
   - Track and monitor user activity across AWS accounts and applications.
   - Generate reports for auditing and compliance purposes.

### Steps to Enable AWS SSO with Google Workspace

Enabling AWS SSO with Google Workspace involves configuring Google Workspace as a SAML 2.0 identity provider (IdP) and AWS SSO as a service provider (SP). Here are the detailed steps:

#### Step 1: Enable AWS SSO

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console.**
2. **Navigate to AWS SSO**:
   - Go to the AWS SSO service page.
3. **Enable AWS SSO**:
   - Click on "Enable AWS SSO."

#### Step 2: Configure Google Workspace as the Identity Provider

1. **Access Google Admin Console**:
   - Sign in to the Google Admin Console (admin.google.com) with an administrator account.
2. **Navigate to Apps**:
   - From the Admin console Home page, go to Apps > Web and mobile apps.
3. **Add a New SAML Application**:
   - Click on "Add app" > "Add custom SAML app."

#### Step 3: Set Up SAML App in Google Workspace

1. **App Details**:
   - Provide an application name (e.g., AWS SSO).
   - Optionally, upload an app icon.

2. **Download IdP Metadata**:
   - Click "Next" and download the IdP metadata file. This file contains the information needed to configure the SAML trust with AWS SSO.

3. **Service Provider Details**:
   - ACS URL: Obtain the ACS URL from AWS SSO. This URL is where the SAML assertion is sent. It usually follows the format: `https://d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/auth/saml/metadata`
   - Entity ID: Use the AWS SSO SAML metadata file to get the Entity ID.
   - Start URL: The URL users will access to initiate SSO, usually the AWS SSO user portal URL.

4. **Name ID**:
   - Set the Name ID format to `EMAIL` and the Name ID to `Primary Email`.

#### Step 4: Configure AWS SSO with Google Workspace IdP Metadata

1. **Return to AWS SSO Console**:
   - Go to AWS SSO settings.
2. **Identity Source**:
   - Under the "Settings" section, click on "Change" next to "Identity Source."
3. **Select External Identity Provider**:
   - Choose "External Identity Provider."
4. **Upload Google Workspace IdP Metadata**:
   - Upload the metadata file you downloaded from the Google Admin Console.

#### Step 5: Configure Attribute Mapping

1. **Attribute Mapping**:
   - Map the attributes from Google Workspace to AWS SSO attributes. Common mappings include:
     - `email` -> `EmailAddress`
     - `firstName` -> `FirstName`
     - `lastName` -> `LastName`

#### Step 6: Assign User Permissions in AWS SSO

1. **Assign Users and Groups**:
   - In the AWS SSO console, go to the "Users" and "Groups" sections to assign users and groups from Google Workspace to AWS SSO.
2. **Assign Applications and AWS Accounts**:
   - Assign access to AWS accounts and applications for the users and groups.

#### Step 7: Test the SSO Configuration

1. **User Access**:
   - Have a user log in to the AWS SSO user portal using their Google Workspace credentials.
2. **Verify Access**:
   - Ensure the user can access the assigned AWS accounts and applications.

### Benefits of AWS SSO

1. **Simplified Access Management**:
   - Centralizes access management across multiple AWS accounts and applications.
2. **Improved Security**:
   - Reduces the risk of credential-related security issues by enabling single sign-on and MFA.
3. **User Convenience**:
   - Provides a seamless user experience by allowing users to sign in once to access all assigned resources.
4. **Compliance and Auditing**:
   - Enhances compliance efforts with detailed auditing and reporting capabilities.

By following these steps, you can successfully enable AWS SSO with Google Workspace, providing a secure and streamlined access experience for your users.
