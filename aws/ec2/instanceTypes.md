2. **T3a**: General-purpose instances featuring AMD EPYC processors with a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. Suitable for web servers, development environments, and small databases.

3. **T3**: Similar to T3a but powered by Intel Xeon processors, offering burstable performance and cost-efficiency for applications with variable workloads.

### Compute Optimized Instances (C Series)

1. **C7g**: Compute-intensive instances powered by AWS Graviton3 processors, optimized for applications requiring high-performance computing, such as batch processing and scientific modeling.

2. **C6g**: Previous generation of compute-intensive instances powered by AWS Graviton2 processors, offering a balance of compute power and cost-effectiveness for compute-bound applications.

3. **C5**: Featuring Intel Xeon processors, C5 instances provide high-performance computing capabilities for applications such as batch processing, distributed analytics, and high-performance web servers.

### Memory Optimized Instances (R Series)

1. **R6g**: Memory-optimized instances powered by AWS Graviton3 processors, designed for memory-intensive applications such as in-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, and high-performance databases.

2. **R5**: Utilizing Intel Xeon processors, R5 instances offer high memory-to-CPU ratio and are suitable for memory-intensive applications like high-performance databases, memory caching, and real-time big data analytics.

### Storage Optimized Instances (I Series)

1. **I3**: Storage-optimized instances featuring high-speed NVMe SSD storage, ideal for I/O intensive applications such as NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and transactional workloads.

2. **I3en**: Enhanced version of I3 instances with larger SSD storage capacity and improved network performance, suitable for data-intensive applications requiring high storage throughput.

### Accelerated Computing Instances (P, G, Inf Series)

1. **P4**: Accelerated computing instances optimized for machine learning inference and training, powered by NVIDIA GPUs.

2. **G4dn**: GPU instances featuring NVIDIA T4 GPUs, designed for graphics-intensive applications, video encoding, gaming, and machine learning.

3. **Inf1**: Instances powered by AWS Inferentia chips for high-performance and cost-effective inferencing for machine learning models.

### Bare Metal Instances

1. **I3 Metal**: Provides direct access to the underlying hardware resources of the host server, offering the performance and capabilities of a physical server with the flexibility of the cloud.

### Example Use Cases for Instance Types
